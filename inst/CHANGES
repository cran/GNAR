0.2.8:	Added in vswind data set and windnetplot function to plot wind network
	(by GPN)

0.3.0: Added S3 methods: AIC, BIC, nobs, predict, simulate, vcov. Removed lmToBIC.
0.3.1: Corrected predict function
0.3.2: Added S3 method logLik
0.3.3: Removed GNARpredict and uses in other functions/help pages. Added warnings to S3 methods where additional arguments (...) are ignored.
0.3.4: Changed NAMESPACE to export non-S3 functions

2.0.0: matrixtoGNAR - negatives and self loops removed (set to zero before converting). List has NULLs for no edges.
	is.GNARnet - negatives, zero distances and self loops return FALSE
	as.GNARnet - don't allow negatives, zero distances and self loops
	GNARdesign - invert the network if its not symmetric, added check for NA in neighbours to give zero entries in matrix
	simulate.GNARfit - for future simulations the network is inverted if not symmetric (otherwise GNARsim is called)
	GNARsim - invert the network if its not symmetric
	NofNeighbours - made more robust to edges NULLs

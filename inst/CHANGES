0.2.8:	Added in vswind data set and windnetplot function to plot wind network
	(by GPN)

0.3.0: Added S3 methods: AIC, BIC, nobs, predict, simulate, vcov. Removed lmToBIC.
0.3.1: Corrected predict function
0.3.2: Added S3 method logLik
0.3.3: Removed GNARpredict and uses in other functions/help pages. Added warnings to S3 methods where additional arguments (...) are ignored.
0.3.4: Changed NAMESPACE to export non-S3 functions

1.0.0: JSS paper ready

1.1.0: matrixtoGNAR - negatives and self loops removed (set to zero before converting). List has NULLs for no edges.
	is.GNARnet - negatives, zero distances and self loops return FALSE
	as.GNARnet - don't allow negatives, zero distances and self loops
	GNARdesign - invert the network if its not symmetric, added check for NA in neighbours to give zero entries in matrix
	simulate.GNARfit - for future simulations the network is inverted if not symmetric (otherwise GNARsim is called)
	GNARsim - invert the network if its not symmetric
	NofNeighbours - made more robust to edges NULLs
1.1.1: Updated CITATION and references in line with JSS publication (10/11/20)
1.1.2: Updated package to include GNARX code in GNARXfit, GNARXdesign and associated help files.  Updated author list accordingly (added James Wei)
       Updated licence URL for wind data
       Added import of "vec" from matrixcalc, export of GNARXdesign, GNARXfit
	Updated GNARsim.Rd slightly for more information about arguments	
	Added GNARXsim.R and GNARXsim.Rd
1.1.3: Corrected "+" typo in logLik.GNARfit
	Edited AIC and BIC documentation files to clarify that the values are without proportionality constants, and are time-normalised versions.
	Added NHS trust hospital admissions data (network and time series)
	Added corbit and Wagner functions and documentation files.  Note corbit_plot, wagner_plot and data documentation files include \dontrun due to computation time
	Added relevant imports and exports for corbit functions into NAMESPACE
	Changed NAMESPACE to move away from using `Depends'.
	Changed DESCRIPTION to reflect additional authors, imports and associated article.

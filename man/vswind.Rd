\title{
Wind Speed example network time series
}
\description{A suite of data objects concerning wind speed analysis.
	The dataset contains a multivariate time series of wind speeds,
	two network descriptions, a vector of names for weather stations,
	and the coordinates of the weather stations.
}
\usage{data("vswind")}
\format{ This dataset contains six R objects:\cr
\code{vswindts} is a \link[stats]{ts} object with a matrix of 721 rows (t=721) and 102 columns (n=102). This corresponds to 721 observations made through time at
102 weather stations.
\code{vswindnetD} is a \code{GNARnet}
	object containing \code{$edges} and \code{$dist}. \cr
\code{edges} is a list of length 102, with \code{edges[[i]]} containing the vertices that node i is connected to. \cr
\code{dist} is a list of length 102, with \code{dist[[i]]} containing the length of the vertices that node i is connected to.
\code{vswindnet} is the same as \code{vswindnetD} except that all the distances
are replaced by 1.
\code{vswindnames} is a character vector of length 102 containing the wind speed
	site names and
\code{vswindcoords} is a matrix with 102 rows (one for each wind station) and
two columns providing the x and y coordinates of the weather stations.
